# Water-Quality-prediction

**Overview**


This project aims to develop a robust water quality prediction system using machine learning techniques, specifically an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) model integrated with feature engineering techniques. The system analyzes various water quality parameters to predict the quality of water, which is crucial for environmental monitoring and public health.

**Features**


Integration of machine learning for water quality prediction.

Utilization of an optimized SVM model for accurate predictions.

Incorporation of feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.

Robustness to handle diverse water quality datasets.

**Installation**

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/water-quality-prediction.git

**Install the required dependencies:**

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**

Prepare your water quality dataset in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel).

Explore and preprocess the dataset using provided scripts or tools of your choice.

Train the SVM model by running the training script.

Evaluate the model performance using test data.

Make predictions on new data using the trained model.
