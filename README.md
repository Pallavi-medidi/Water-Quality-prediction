# Water-Quality-prediction

**Overview**

Water quality prediction is a critical aspect of environmental monitoring and public health management. It involves analyzing various parameters of water bodies to assess their quality, which helps in identifying potential risks and taking preventive measures. In this project, we aim to develop a robust water quality prediction system using machine learning techniques, specifically an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) model integrated with feature engineering techniques.

The primary objective of this project is to accurately predict water quality based on a set of input parameters. By utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms and feature engineering methods, we intend to create a predictive model that can effectively analyze water quality data and provide reliable predictions. This system will serve as a valuable tool for environmental scientists, policymakers, and public health officials to monitor and manage water resources effectively.
